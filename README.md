# Simulation of a Pandemic
Analysis of two different models for simulating a biological Virus

As part of my Matur paper at the Kantonsschule Zürich Nord in Zürich, Switzerland in 2020/2021 (submitted in the november of 2021) I investigated how a virus is going to spread in a pandemic. I made a comparison between two well working models for the simualtion of a virus in order to determine which one delivers the more accurate data. The data of the two models was compared to the current coronavirus data to further analyze their accuracy. 
As I am still new to the world of programming, the programs i wrote are quite messy and the structure of whole work can be confusing. Do not hesitate to ask me if something is not understandable. 
The Matura paper can be found in the school library in Switzerland or can be sent as a PDF on demand.
